However, the main problem that MOND was introduced to solve has an adequate and vastly simpler alternative solution (dark matter), and these days MOND doesn't even fully solve that problem on its own and still needs some dark matter to match observations.\\n\\nSo, you're calling what is arguably the simplest solution to a set of real problems a \"gigantic hack\" while comparing it to a non-solution to a different problem that already has a much simpler solution.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, we need an actual solution to things like the horizon problem.  The phrasing you used to characterize inflation makes it sound like you would consider *any* solution to be a \"hack\" simply because it would be more complicated than current models without any solution, and that seems misguided.

These also tend to have shorter dates on them, because they can go bad much quicker. The temperature of storage also makes a big difference to these - if kept refrigerated they will probably outlast their dates, if kept in a warm storage room they likely won't. Anyway, the active yeast will be slowly consuming any sugars still present in the drink, the rate depending on temperature. So the drink will eventually end up very dry, sour and probably somewhat over-carbonated - if the bottle hasn't exploded by that time!\\n\\nFor the other category you mentioned where the drink is exposed to the air, it depends on what the alcohol content starts at. For spirits, they will at first lose alcohol by evaporation, until the percentage by volume drops to a level where bacteria can actually survive in the solution. From that point, bacteria will start to grow, including the type which metabolise alcohol into acetic acid.\\n\\nFor wines and beers, the bacterial contamination will begin much more quickly (within days) if open to the air. So again, bacteria will start to grow, and the alcohol content will start being converted into acetic acid, forming vinegar. If enough bacteria grow, you can end up with a slimy layer on the top, which is a combination of the bacteria themselves and their other metabolic products, one of which is cellulose, which forms the slime or jelly-like substance, known in the brewing trade as \"mother of vinegar\". The reason it has this name is that you can take a piece of this and add it to any other wine or beer and it will kick-start the vinegar production at an accelerated rate.\\n\\nIf you want a vinegar acceptable for use as a condiment or in cooking, then you ideally want an acetic acid content somewhere between 3 and 6 %, and a residual alcohol content between 0.5 and 1 %. If the bacterial fermentation is allowed to continue until all the alcohol is consumed, then different bacteria take over which start consuming the acetic acid. They will then carry on doing that until all the acetic acid is gone too, and then you will be left with basically water with a lot of dead bacteria in it.

            "Texto 79: This is a hard problem to answer precisely. It is sometimes called the protein folding problem. However, there are physical tendencies and regularities that can be used for understanding.\\n\\nFirst and probably easiest regularity is that the core of a protein (the part not exposed to the water solvent) is predominately hydrophobic. One way to think of it is that water don’t want those aliphatic chains messing with the nice hydrogen bonds, so amino acids like leucine, iso-leucine, methionine, phenylalanine are pushed away from contact with water. \\n\\nConversely many polar amino acids, like glutamate, lysine, end up at the exterior of the protein in contact with the water solvent.\\n\\nMinor note, there are membrane proteins that cross cell membranes. These membranes are hydrophobic in nature, and in those cases the regularities above are inverted. But I limit myself to discuss proteins that are mostly in contact with water inside and outside cells.\\n\\nHowever, the backbone of a protein contains polar groups. It can be attractive sometimes to bury a polar amino acid side-chain in the core too, and to bind with the buried polar groups. For reasons I will not get into here, buried hydrogen bonds can be very strong. If you find a protein with a buried hydrogen bond, you can expect that to be an important bond to stability or possibly function of said protein. Sometimes you can even have buried “salt bridges” where a negatively charged side-chain (like glutamate) is interacting with a positively charged side-chain (like lysine), and those will be quite strong.\\n\\nThere are a few special-case amino acids. Proline for example has an odd structure in that its side-chain binds to the backbone twice, not just to the alpha-carbon. Proline tends to “bend” the backbone differently from other amino acids. Therefore if you have one or several nearby prolines in the sequence, that very likely corresponds to a place where the protein forms a loop in terms of its tertiary structure.\\n\\nAnother special case is glycine, since it lacks a side-chain entirely. That leads to a more flexible backbone. \\n\\nAnother special case is histidine. This is an amino acid that has a pKa close to physiological pH. That means that by modest changes to the environment, this amino acid can flip between uncharged to charged. You can think of histidine as a way to functionally encode a pH switch. That means histidines tend to show up in places where some such functionality is needed. Great example is the FcRn binding of antibodies.\\n\\nAnother special case is cystine. This is the only amino acid that can form a covalent bond between side-chains. So called sulphur bridges can form between pairs of cystine side-chains. Covalent bonds are strong and add a great deal to protein stability. So again, if you see cystine amino acids in the sequence, they are often going to become part of sulphur bridges with other cystine amino acids in the sequence of with other chains in a quaternary structure.\\n\\nA key point in all this is that the tertiary structure is determined by interactions between pairs (or higher) of amino acids. You can therefore never fully say what one particular amino acid side-chain will end up in the tertiary structure. You can say some things to be more or less likely based on the regularities above. However, to say anything with more certainty requires more careful analysis. \\n\\nLet me take one special observed regularity. The so called [leucine zipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucine_zipper) is a motif wherein leucine appears at every seventh sequence position for some stretch. This can be explained as it leads to very favourable dimerization of two helices such that the leucine side-chains “zip up” very well together (recall they are highly hydrophobic). So if you happen to see a handful of leucine amino acids spaced seven positions apart in the sequence, you might guess that’s going to be part of a tertiary (or quaternary) structure of a leucine zipper.\\n\\nThere are other such regularities. However, they are rarely perfect and rarely sufficient to figure out tertiary structures from sequence alone. For that you need to consider more relations that are more complex that these types of rules-of-thumb I’ve outlined above. \\n\\nIt is also noteworthy that for most proteins, their tertiary structure is stable under single mutations (say you replace one amino acid with another). So again one single amino acid side-chain change often (not always) does not change the higher-order structure. Some tertiary structures are extremely stable under most mutations. The [immunoglobulin domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_domain) is a good example of a higher-order protein structure that appears in many quite distinct proteins, and nowadays one can predict if a sequence will form such a structure pretty well because of certain highly conserved features in the sequence.\\n\\nAnyways, this can go on for long, and structural biology is the place to study this in more detail. Your teacher’s hesitancy to provide details is understandable since it is not an easy problem with a big body of research literature and without simple or certain rules if you go beyond the most basic regularities.\n",

            "Texto 194: I'll disagree with saying dopamine is \"the cause\" of addiction. Here's my view. Addiction is a lock and key. If you gave Adderall to a large random sample some would hate it, some would not. Some fraction would be more mentally effective but not addicted, and some would become addicted regardless of any pharmacological benefit.\\n\\nAn example: I was on morphine for about 2 weeks after serious surgery when I was in my early 20s. I was taken off of it fairly suddenly when I went home. I had physical withdrawal but didn't realize it, and called my doctor with \"odd\" symptoms. He literally laughed on the phone but didn't say why, and gave me a prescription for a tranquilizer for a week or two. A few days later a friend explained it. So, did I crave opiates when I went off, or after I found out what happened? No. Would I have considered it taking it if I could somehow get it free and safely? Not even a little. I have a life to lead, thank you. What about years later when I went through chronic depression and had had personal experience or familiarity with more addictive things? No, never called to me. Does that make me better than an addict? Absolutely not, just lucky in that particular way. \\n\\nAs a baseline (possibly genetic), most people have very low to moderately low vulnerability to addiction, but more is fairly common. If someone with significant baseline potential is in a situation of chronic pain, either physical or emotional, their vulnerability goes up rapidly in proportion to the pain.\\n\\nEmotional pain can be things people don't even realize is pain because they've normalized it. Low self esteem, a bad marriage, a sense of failure, a phobia or chronic anxiety, fear about a large scale issue like climate change, or chronic hate (at the government, women, themselves, or whatever).\\n\\nWhy have addiction rates skyrocketed in the US? You don't have to be anyplace on the political spectrum, and barely awake, to know the problem. Suicide and crime rates skyrocketing. Obesity and diabetes skyrocketing. People hate social media and use it more than ever. Ever larger corporations and no privacy. The country has been gradually tearing itself apart more and more.\\n\\nThere is one and only one trigger for addiction rates climbing ever since The US Vietnam War and 60's social strife, up through the (current) pandemic and strife. One trigger: increasing chronic, individual pain. Any coincidence that the steepest climb in addictions lately is in pain medication? I think not.\\n\\nEdit: typos\n",

There's one parameter (called Θ) in our equations that determines how frequent those processes should occur, and this is something we have to measure experimentally and cannot derive theoretically, just like the masses of particles, their charges or how strong certain interactions are.\\n\\nAnd we experimentally find that those processes...have never occured once since we started looking for them in the 70's. So, it's pretty plausible that the parameter Θ is zero. We can't know for sure, though, and it could also be super super tiny.\\n\\nWell, it turns out that if this parameter Θ isn't just a fixed number, but another quantum mechanical field, then it would automatically cause those processes to never occur. Of course, this is a slightly more complex mechanism (replacing a number with a field), but it would work perfectly - and this is basically what we also did with particle masses. Before we treated them as pure numbers, but then Higgs came up with the idea that those might be caused by a field. And every field comes with a particle attached to it, and as you might have heard, we found that Higgs-particle.\\n\\nSo, if there is a field for our parameter Θ, then this also comes with another particle, and this is the axion. The existence of this particle would immediatly solve our original problem of possible processes never occuring, it would also be very, very light and have all the properties we need for a dark matter particle. And us cosmologists need dark matter to explain a lot about the universe - there seems to be a lot more mass in the universe than we can find. And we notice this lack of mass in many, many different scenarios.\\n\\nThe axion could easily solve two of the biggest outstanding problems in physics, the strong CP problem and the dark matter problem. And it comes as natural as the Higgs-mechanism. It's almost too good to be true.\n",

Add a pinch of ordinary table salt to acrylic paints and it will destabilize, separate and you get a clear layer of water on top of thick sludge.  Analogy is you have a stable positive magnet floating and then you toss a whole bunch of negative magnets to make it crash.  Most polymers are stable only at certain controlled ionic balances.  Some stains work by sticking really tightly to the surface of a material, almost like a magnet or velcro.  Stain()+ <---> (-)fibre.   Blood, some paints, protein and a few others.  Adding a whole bunch of salt overwhelms any ionic interactions and disrupts the intermolecular interactions bonds so you end up with stain.Cl and fibre.Na.  The stain material just falls off.\\n\\nSecond: Vinegar that has been neutralized or in the acetate form is very good at \"chelating\" calcium compounds.  Your acrylic paint probably contains about 20% calcite (chalk) as a filler.  By using the acetate ion you remove the calcite, which loosens all the paint.\\n\\nThird: pH effects.  The acrylic latex usually contains a lot of acid functional groups from acrylic acid polymers.  When you add ammonia it can make the polymer soften.  Tough to explain the chemical theory, but acrylic polymers change hardness (glass transition) by a lot depending if they are at high or low pH (ionic or neutral acid form).  As the ammonia evaporates your solution pH will also drop.  By swapping pH you are doing the chemical equivalent of pushing it backwards and forwards.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nForth: salt is a mild abrasive.

            "Texto 416: I can attest from personal experience it is impossible to ride with more than a small amount of weight. I'm sure many a child has figured out the hard way that letting go of the handlebars while an external force is acting on them (such as wind, a bag of groceries, or a dog leash) is an extremely bad idea. The precise effect depends on the bicycle geometry - the fork angle, wheel offset, handlebar width, handle bar offset from the axis of steering, the rider's weight and position. For example shorter handlebar offsets causes lateral loads to contribute more to leaning the bike, whereas longer offsets causes the load to produce more steer and offset the weight from the steering axis considerably. The tire's trail affects how the bike handles at a given steer and lean angle. Most of the time though, the slackened steering produces a reversed castor wheel effect, a bag of groceries on one side will mostly tend to just steer very severely that direction in an attempt to reach the local minima of the slanted steering axis. Depending on the exact geometry, skill, weight, etc it's possible to just no-hands around in a circle with a weight on one bar, where the steering force is counteracted by the centripetal normal force, as that weight is directly analogous to a rider applying the same load with their hands to enter a turn, however this represents a singular self-stable state. If the bag is swinging around dramatically from the unsteadiness it would produce, you now have this crazy double-pendulum chaotic system. The question gets more interesting when you add a dog leash to the equation, as the force can now act along angles that the bike was not designed to self-stabilize against. The leash can be pulling out of a turn while the bike is attempting to steer into it which can cause sudden inversions in the force vectors along an unexpected axis, leading to undesireable behavior such as the wheel suddenly being oversteered, or the bike leaning out of a turn while steering into it. One can easily experiment with this unusual dynamic system with just two bikes - by riding one and pushing another beside yourself by the handlebars, you can feel how changing the position of your hand on the bar changes how the driving, slowing, banking, and steering forces all get mixed up.\n",

            "Texto 455: Hello, I'm kinda stressing out about choosing to major in chemistry or some biological science.  \\nA little background:  \\nI am currently a sophomore in college. I entered as a computer science major. I have done really well so far, currently having a 3.97 GPA. Over this past year, my Grandfather entered hospice care. I have been taking care of him at night and in the mornings. I help him go to the bathroom and make sure he is clean. I give him baths and help administer medicine. I guess I'm trying to say I enjoy taking care of him. I feel drawn to the healthcare field now and I no longer really love computer science. I used to code for fun(make apps/build websites) but haven't felt the urge or desire to attempt any new projects. Looking out 5/10 years from now I don't really see myself being happy with software development even if there is a lot of money to be made. I think I want to become a doctor. I have always had a heart for taking care of people and I think becoming a doctor would be incredibly rewarding.  \\nAnyways, I decided to take gen chem and biology as electives alongside my CS courses this semester to see if I could major in one of them. I am doing well in both of them right now with A's. I enjoy both courses but was wondering which one would be a better fit for me. Biology seems to involve a lot more memorization but also looks at how larger systems work. This is somewhat similar to CS problem solving in that it breaks complex systems into smaller ones that are more easily manageable. My chem course has more problem solving and math. I'm not the biggest fan of memorizing info even though I am pretty good at it. I enjoy math and breaking a problem down into more logical steps. I would rather work on 20 calculus problems for a couple of hours than review notecards for a couple of hours. I was wondering at the higher levels which major would suit my learning style better.  \\n   \\nIf anyone could help me out I would appreciate It. I apologize for any grammar/writing errors. I have never been too good at writing. Thanks again.\n",

[https://hypertextbook.com/facts/1999/MariaPereyra.shtml](https://hypertextbook.com/facts/1999/MariaPereyra.shtml) Gives us the slowest speed of a shotgun slug at about 335 m/s, and if we are goint to take the .2s reaction time from the first article as our standard, that means we need to be about 67m away to have any time at all to move, and we need to add on the amount of time (and therefore distance) we need to actually do the moving. A 12 gauge shotgun slug is about 18mm accross so let's say that's how far you need to move your hand to not get hit. How long does it take someone to move their hand 18mms? I have no idea and no clue how I'd find that out, but I'd bet it's not very long. Let's call it a tenth of a second, not including reaction time. So that gives us a range of about 99m. All of this is assuming, of course, that you only notice the shot when it just leaves the barrel. It doesn't take into account the tiny bits of time it takes for a trigger pull to translate into a hammer strike, and the travel down the barrel, which would give you more time.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo if someone shoots at the edge of your body, with a slow shotgun slug, from across a football field, yeah probably. Looking it up some, a 12 gauge is still accurate at that range, but with a significantly decreased amount of force, so your dodge is probably helpful, if you pick the right direction.\n",

This is something I find super surprising – why should the acetyl be cleaved off? It's an amide, so…super stable? I know what you are about to say: maybe it's just something that happens in the LCMS through ionization! 1. there was an extra peak for this mass in the UV and molecule e also kinda proves that c really exists.  \\nAlso, I expect **c** to undergo an S-N acyl shift, so I would obtain an amide and a free cysteine (**shown in d**).

When climeworks or anyone else captures CO2, there will be a fixed energy cost. It won’t vary based on whether the CO2 being captured came from burning coal or natural gas or from some natural process. All of these will generate CO2 with different amounts of energy produced. Like I said before, carbon capture isn’t trying to reverse the initial carbon emission process. The CO2 ends up bound in a different molecule or solid than it initially was before it was emitted. In fact, when gas phase CO2 binds to a typical adsorbent, it is energetically favored for the CO2 to be bound, so that energy will be released in the form of heat. This heating up of the material upon CO2 adsorption is actually problematic sometimes since the heat has to be dissipated for more CO2 to bind, depending on the way CO2 binds to the material. \\n\\nIn this type of adsorbing set up, the main energy cost is associated with desorption of the CO2. The energy inputted to desorb the CO2 is completely independent of the energy gained when the coal or oil was burned. The energy needed to desorb the bound CO2 depends only on the specifics of the adsorbing materials, and we are capable of generating materials with a large range of adsorption enthalpies.\n",

            "Texto 647: This is wrong, as has been mentioned elsewhere.\\n\\nWe know a ton about DM and it is not a placeholder for anything. We know how much of it there was at the point of last scattering due to precision measurements of the CMB's temperature temperature correlation (as well as from polarization information). We also know how much there was due to measurements of the abundances of light elements. It is because these two measurements agree that we *really* believe that DM is what we think it is. But we also know its radial profile in galaxies, that it doesn't interact with regular matter much, that it doesn't interact with itself much, that it clumps, that this clumpiness dictates the large scale structure of the universe, and probably other things that I'm forgetting. All of these things point to a self consistent picture of a cold fluid that has thermally evolved like matter and has been present in corresponding densities since the very early universe.\\n\\nA lot of non-physicists have this idea that DM is just rotation curves and nothing else. That is *not* why we believe DM exists, although it is one more data set that points to a consistent picture, and it is the first data set pointing towards DM, but far from the most precise.\\n\\nAs for DE, it is also not a placeholder. We see that we have recently (a few billion years ago) entered into a DE dominated era where the evolution of the Hubble parameter is increasingly dominated by DE. The primary data set for this is type 1a SNe. While this data set is tricky, there are a large number of independent checks of DE, notably intrinsic curvature. In addition, we have looked for higher order moments in the acceleration of the universe and not found any, suggesting that DE is what we think it is. Finally, we know that the equation of state of DE is close to -1 as expected from the cosmological constant.\\n\\nWhat is going on right now in these areas? Many things. For DM, people are using the open data from experiments like GAIA to detect substructures in the galactic DM halo, which is mind boggilingly awesome. As for DE, with upcoming experiments like Vera Rubin we will increase our SNe data set by orders of magnitude.\\n\\nFinally, the dark sector mentioned in this article isn't the same as dark energy or dark matter, although it could be. Despite the fact that these names all sound related and very vague - dark sector, dark matter, dark energy - they are distinct things. The article is about neutrinos and an anomaly at 4.8sig that just got weirder: obvious explanations don't work so people are turning to less obvious things. This is the way discoveries work. Something strange happens in the data (MiniBooNE sees an excess), the simplest interpretation is investigated (a sterile neutrino), so follow up experiments are built to robustly test this. MicroBooNE just reported their first test of MiniBooNE's excess and, in a different kind of experiment, they don't see it. But the MiniBooNE result has been checked to hell and back, it is pretty hard to believe that it is just an experimental problem, although it could be. Thus people are considering new physics scenarios other than sterile neutrinos and these scenarios often go under the umbrella term of dark sector, although it's a pretty shit name just like dark matter and dark energy.\n",

But the thermodynamics doesn't care. Thermodynamics only states how energy will change eventually, there's absolutely no timeline on that change. In other words, thermodynamics states that when the solution crystallizes, it will be exothermic by X amount. That could happen immediately if you cool it too fast and don't achieve that metastable state, or it could happen the moment you give a metastable state a nucleation site. That energy is coming from all the interactions formed and lost (lost interactions with water, gained bonds between ions, in this case), so that energy comes only comes into play when it actually crystallizes. \\n\\nI'm not going to explain why crystallizing sodium acetate is exothermic here.

When a rocket is moving quickly, the rocket is extracting more kinetic energy from the fuel than it does at rest (as seen from an outside observer).\\n\\nKeep in mind that chemical energy rockets do not follow F=ma, and their acceleration is not constant nor proportional to their instantaneous mass (the actual equation is F = m * dV/dt + dm/dt * V, though if the fuel mass flow is small compared to the rocket mass, F=ma is pretty dang close).\n",

I was under the impression that nebulizer did break them down to individual atoms via vibrations or something. But the nebulizer still can make the B vitamins carry it a steam by making them as a whole into small enough particles that can be carried and absorbed, and if it gets to the LUNGS which are equipped to separate OXYGEN atoms from the other things in the air and absorb, why can't it do the same for the vitamin supplement that have other ingredients mixed in with them that are attached and then get rid of those (as it does with carbon, hydrogen etc from oxygen) and absorb the essential vitamins which your body recognizes ? But if you inject them directly without first separating all the individual ingredients  and making them into a small particle it won't work? Because once in the blood it cant separate or use enzymes to make it into a usable form particle? And also the lungs can alter PH levels. Vitamin C for example is made out of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen. So your telling me the lungs won't absorb vitamin C because it has hydrogen and carbon? Doesn't the lungs absorb some carbon and hydrogen accidently?  But then again your lungs do absorb smoke and all its chemicals from cigars into blood even though it is not meant to it still does.\\n\\n>Why does it feel like I'm doing your homework? For your body to use them it needs to be broken down to individual atoms not particles. You are probably better off posting to r/Chemistry because at this point that is what you are brushing up against. You do realize that at these scales pretty much all chemistry including all your biological processes are powered by random chance of molecules bumping into one another. The sheer numbers of atoms and molecules involved allow this to be possible. That is also why most life relies on water because it is an excellent solvent which facilities the transportation of molecules leading to said chance encounters for interactions to occur. It is an oversimplification but the chemistry in question can generally be seen as a microscopic mechanical process. Molecules be they vitamins, drugs, or even parts of cells in your body fit together perfectly like 3D puzzle pieces when interacting. Therefore said interactions aren't going to be possible with particles nomatter how small until they are broken down into individual molecules. Again at this point you are really talking chemistry more than biology. As for PH levels affecting absorption rates yes it plays a huge role but again this will be dependent upon the vitamin in question. Again this would depend on the vitamin in question, some are water soluble whereas others are oil soluble. Vibration on the molecular level is heat. Such a miniscule amount of vibration on tiny granules isn't going to do much to change them. This would be a physical change but common filler ingredient such as microcrystalline cellulose or maltodextrin are used for the aforementioned uniformity in granule size and wouldn't be affected by such vibrations but they will be broken down in your digestive system by chemical processes some as simple as being dissolved in water and other bodily fluids.\n",

Viruses exist to only to replicate. \\n\\nViruses are completely reliant on a host to do the replication for them. \\n\\nVirulence is a human created term to categorize the severity of illness caused by a viral infection. \\n\\nSome viruses cause little, if any, ill effect on the host.\\n\\nSome viruses cause the host to fall ill for prolonged periods of time. \\n\\nSome viruses can infect a host for the duration of the host's life. \\n\\nSome viruses can cause severe acute illness followed by death. \\n\\nSome viruses infect a host just once but leave the host forever scarred or with significant long-term health issues \\n\\nMany viruses are host specific, meaning they can only infect a certain specie(s).  \\n\\nViruses infect very specific cellular systems within the host specie(s).  \\n\\nThoes infected cells are \"hijacked\" by the viral genetic information and given instruction to replicate the virus over and over and over again until the infected cell bursts with millions of copies of the virus.  \\n\\nThe replicated viral copies quickly infect the adjoining cells and the process repeats until either all the cells are destroyed or the immune system of the host gets the viral invasion under control. \\n\\nMutations during the replication process drive the evolution and success of viruses. \\n\\nThe more the virus is able to replicate, the higher the probability of a mutation occurring. \\n\\nMutation are caused by errors made in the replication process.  Nearly all mutations are unsuccessful dead-ends for the virus. \\n\\nSome chance random mutations may make the virus more successful. \\n\\nA \"beneficial\" mutation may give a virus ability to replicate at a greater rate, in greater numbers, infect different cellular systems or even infect other species.\\n\\nWhen a virus mutates to infect a new  specie(s), it becomes a novel virus for the new host(s). \\n\\nA novel virus can be highly virulent on a new host because the new host has no immunity to combat the virus. \\n\\nA novel virus can replicate unchecked within the new host specie because there is no \"programed\" immune response to combat the novel viral infection.  \\n\\nWhen a virus is given the opportunity to replicate unimpeded, the probability of a successful mutations increases. \\n\\nAs the virus mutates through host replication, it may become more virulent on the host. \\n\\nIf a virus is overly virulent on its host, it often leads to an evolutionary dead end - in other words, if all the hosts are killed by a virus, the virus won't be able to replicate and will go extinct.\\n\\nOver time, natural selection tends to favor the mutations that make virus more transmissible over mutations that make it more virulent. \\n\\nThe most successful viruses are ones that have evolved to be highly transmissible but have minimal virulent effects on the host. \\n\\nSome viruses can be highly virulent on certain individuals in the host population and have no virulent impact on other individuals within the same population. \\n\\nOver time, the genetic traits in thoes unaffected individuals will be passed along to subsequent generations and become the dominant trait within the host population.  \\n\\nThis relationship between viruses and their hosts has been ongoing for hundreds of millions of years. It's known as an evolutionary \"arms race\". \\n\\nViruses have always, and will continue to always be one of the selection factors driving the evolution and diversity of species on our planet.  \\n\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nAgain, I tried to make the information very simple and loose.

The aim of the experiment was to find if prolonged storage has any effect on L-ascorbic acid. I had several samples of ascorbic acid ( new, opened for week, opened for 3 months, and opened for more than  a year). I used titration method using DCPIP to found out if there are any changes. Firstly, the results show that there is more ascorbic acid than I actually used (I made a solution using 0.1g of ascorbic acid and 500ml of water, all the results show that there was more than 0.1g used which I can't explain. Secondly, I have repeated the experiment 4x and there is always an significant outlier. Also, I was doing the titration very precisely, but in some of the samples I had difficultly to find concordant titres.  Lastly, most of the results show that the older samples have more ascorbic acid in them than the new ones. I don't understand what's going on and I can't explain the results.  After the first round of inconclusive results we bought new equipment (scales, DCPIP, and used also other samples of ascorbic acid), I have shown my calculations to 4 different teachers to make sure that everything is correct, and each titre was repeated many times. If you could give me any suggestions, I would be extremely thankful 🙏.\n",

            "Texto 790: Within the Standard Model of particle physics, electrons are part of a group of particles called leptons, which also includes the electron's heavier brothers the muon and the tauon, and their respective neutrinos. Electrons differ from muons and tauons only in mass: their charge and other fundamental properties are exactly the same.\\n\\nWe expect that the muon, being a heavier lepton, will decay into an electron over time, as will the tauon, which can decay into a muon or an electron. Importantly however, the Standard Model predicts that the decay rate from a tauon to an electron should be the same as the decay rate from a muon to an electron, up to a factor of their masses. As all the other properties between muons and tauons are the same, only their *mass* can affect the decay rate. This is called *lepton universality*, and it basically means that leptons only differ from each other in their mass, and interactions cannot depend on their flavor.\\n\\nA test of lepton universality is to take very heavy mesons, like the B meson (which contains a bottom quark), and observe its decay. B mesons will decay into K mesons by having their bottom quark decay into a strange quark, and this decay is mediated by the weak force, which allows coupling to leptons. Lepton universality then allows us to predict how many muons vs tauons we expect to see when these decays happen, and a couple of years ago we found a 2-3σ deviation from the theory, suggesting that lepton universality is not correct. This deviation was not large enough however to warrant a claim of \"new physics\" having been observed, for that we would need a >5σ detection.\\n\\nThe new results from LHCb repeat this 2-3σ deviation. It's consistent, but still not sufficient for new physics.\n",

I think your definition of free will is insufficient.\\n\\nIn AI and economics there is the concept of an agent with goals. A rational agent acts to achieve some goal (win the chess game, get the car to the destination) by choosing actions, or sequences of actions, based on their perceived utility towards achieving that goal. Things in the real world have a finite perception of the options they have and the consequences of their actions, and often even a limited conscious understanding of their own goals,  easily confusing the utility measured towards towards their final goals (??) with utility towards lesser goals instrumental towards final goals (reproduction, consuming calories in preparation for hard times, etc).\\n\\nMillions of years of evolution and a lifetime of social conditioning have been tweaking the way species and individuals perceive and weigh their options in different situations.

It applies about the same for flue streams as it does to atmospheric CO2, which is why I brought it up. The fundamental point is that when it comes to capturing carbon, the way the CO2 was generated doesn’t affect the energy required to capture it at all. \\n\\n(If you just feel like skimming the rest of this, see the paragraphs I say are the most important one. It provides links to journal articles which directly address what thermodynamic processes are important in determining the limits of direct air capture. One passage from one of the journal articles directly addresses and contradicts your claim.)\\n\\nDo you think that people who research carbon capture whether from coal/natural gas plants or from the atmosphere are just missing this very straightforward energy argument you’re making? Process chemistry analysis of the feasibility of carbon capture is done on all of these different capture environments. Have these people missed out on the apparent massive flaw in direct air capture? If you read such a paper, it even talks about energy requirements and related concerns for carbon capture. A conclusion you won’t find in this analysis is that “carbon capture is pointless because the energy required to capture the carbon is too high.” You can read this article (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2020.00092/full). Note the following quotation “Based on these studies, DAC is currently considered as an energy-intensive and costly approach for removing CO2 from the atmosphere. However, researchers believe that the high cost and energy consumption in such systems are mostly due to the immaturity of the technology, and hence DAC may be eventually considered as a viable option for removing CO2 from the atmosphere.” There’s no suggestion that DAC is futile because of thermodynamics restrictions. Perhaps you have a reservation about this journal (I know it’s maybe a little controversial - my main experience with it has been with a very high quality review article I read in it on a different topic though), in which case I’m sure you can find other articles on this topic in other journals, although the corresponding author’s google scholar looks legitimate enough. \\n\\n(These next 2 paragraphs are the most important part of my reply)\\n\\nYou can also check out (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00173) which is a very well cited review on direct air capture. They even have a thermodynamics section toward the end. Note that they even mention the second law of thermodynamics, but the process they are applying it to is CO2 binding to the adsorbent and then having it unbind. Citation 28 of that paper directly addresses a theoretical lower bound for the energy requirements in section 2.1. Here’s a link for a pdf of it. (https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00003926/document) The paragraphs at the start of section 2 explain how the relevant thermodynamic process doesn’t involve whatever it was that initially put the CO2 there, but rather have to do with adsorption and desorption from the material. Note how they don’t even mention the source of the CO2 in the atmosphere. \\n\\nThat article in citation 28 even has this quotation “The ∼4 GJ/tC minimum may be compared to the carbon-specific energy content of fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas have about 40, 50, and 70 GJ/tC respectively. Thus if the energy for air capture is provided by fossil fuels then the amount of carbon captured from the air can—in principle—be much larger than the carbon content of the fuel used to capture it. The fuel carbon can, of course, be captured as part of the process rather than being emitted to the air.” This directly shows that your claim is incorrect. \\n\\nI’m not trying to be argumentative for its own sake; your claim sounded intuitive enough that I figured people might read it, think it sounded right, and then move on with a very misinformed opinion on direct air capture. In another thread on this subreddit I even saw a similar claim to the one you made being made, so it seems like others find this type of argument compelling, but I’m not sure where it’s coming from. \\n\\nRegarding your other point, I don’t understand why the main thing you responded to had to do with the greenhouse effect either. Obviously CO2 is a greenhouse gas. My point was that the CO2 that gets captured may or may not be in an excited vibrational state when it gets captured. Ultimately, it doesn’t even matter for the rest of the argument though. The 2 main paragraphs above show that your thermodynamic argument is incorrect with peer-reviewed journal articles.\n",

Don't worry about the different line styles, they are details of the specific model in this paper. But in general we see that the universe used to be radiation dominated (teal), but radiation redshifts away very quickly and its energy density goes like a^-4 . Next we have a matter^1 (brown) dominated region since its energy density decreases only like a^-3 . But there is also dark energy (purple) whose energy density remains constant in time: a^0 .

If, instead of a towel on a surface, you replace it with a single hole in the light blocking object, what you end up with is a [camera obscura](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsXo4gD7iWI).  Another related phenomenon is the \"eclipse shadow\" (just do an image search). During an eclipse, the shadows look like little crescent shapes – in that case, you can't treat the light source as a single point, but have to acknowledge that it has a shape.\n",

Now, yes there are a lot of specific nuances to this idea, but that's what research is for, right? Some issues to consider: how to ensure that the new antigen gene gets put in a safe spot of our genome (not splitting important genes); ensuring regular but not too active transcription; would it lead to a sort of \"tolerance\" to the antigen, causing our bodies to no longer react to the antigen.

Instead it is taken on good faith that the data was not fabricated (of course, patently absurd results would require more proof). One reason this is fine is because any result important enough to be replicated _will_ be replicated, and if other groups are unable to do so that will raise concern (which is what happened in this case). In very unique cases such as LIGO, where it's not feasible or even possible for other groups to replicate the results, more care has to be taken to ensure the authenticity of the results.

Other ingredients include various kinds of alcohols - methanol, ethanol, propanol - we encounter these in everyday life. They all have noticeable odours; but in low concentration the vapour isn’t something to worry about. Ethanol is the alcohol we find in wine, beer and spirits, the other alcohols are not something you should drink. Propanol is in rubbing alcohol and hand sanitizer. Methanol is used in fuel - but methanol is poisonous. You can find it in ‘moonshine’, that home made illicit booze. Drinking it is very risky (blindness, even death). But a faint smell of methanol is not really something to worry about. If you look at page 10 of that safety data sheet, it shows the toxic limits, but it takes some interpretation. Napthalene is toxic at 250ppm (parts per million, less than the other ingredients) but napthalene is what they make mothballs out of, and people happily put them in clothes closets for decades. It’s not very volatile, but you can definitely smell it. If you’ve thrown it all away, that’s OK. If you have clothing that’s come into contact with it, or you can smell it on that clothing, just wash that clothing. Some of the chemicals in the list are the same as those you smell in over-ripe fruit like bananas. Amyl acetate is used to make flavourings and scents.

Plus, the more people are vaccinated the better because the virus won't be able to transmit so easily, replicate and MUTATE. So we are more likely to get worse COVID variants if there are not enough people vaccinated. Not to mention there's a higher chance that he will spread it to his grandma or something. \\n\\n2. I honestly can't think how you can hit an artery in the upper arm muscle? Or even a major blood vessel.   But let's assume the vaccine goes straight into the blood stream. Nano-lipid particles are quite fragile. They're often covered in PEG to even make them stay longer in the bloodstream otherwise they would get opsonised and eaten by macrophages quickly. In order for these nano-lipids to \"enter every cell of the body\" they would have to extravasate from the blood stream and that wouldn't be so easy either (not to mention there wouldn't be enough of them to enter every cell). Usually people rely on cancer vasculature to be more \"leaky\" and try to use liposomes as drug carriers for instance. Because they would in theory accumulate in tumour. Probably the worst case scenario if by some miracle you injected the vaccine into the bloodstream would be that you might not develop an immunological memory for COVID or feel a bit worse. Even if mRNA entered some other cells, they would just start producing this spike protein. And sure, the immune cells would destroy these \"infected\" cells but there's nowhere near enough mRNA injected to cause any real damage that way (especially if it's dispersed and \"diluted\" in your body in this scenario). So essentially in the muscle the cells will start producing the spike protein (which is not secretory because some people wrongly suggest that you have a lot of this protein accumulated in your body), the immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) would find it, carry it to lymph nodes and activate T cells and B cells. There are a lot of DCs in the muscle so it's a great place to inject a vaccine. \\n\\n3. I honestly can't see how an mRNA vaccine can mess up your immune system and make it not work properly. It just mimicks what happens in any other viral infection. Your friend's argument is sooo general it's annoying. If he told you a suggested mechanism of action of this, then we can discuss. But like this? He should provide a source with a proof of that. \\n\\n4. Some people already answered. I don't really know the history of mRNA vaccine clinical trials so I won't say much. But let's not forget some companies didn't manage to make good mRNA vaccines for COVID (and tried), and that a lot of money and effort from thousands of scientist went to make these vaccines work.

It is by using a Lorentz Transformation.  When the above posters talk about blue shifted light coming from the bullet this is related.  Due to the nature space-time warping at relativistic speeds the energies involved become a hindrance thus creating a cost for objects of mass in typical space-time system where they can't reach c.  As it creates an asymptotic energy cost to reach c.

Men, subconsciously, can detect these chemicals, and bonding is influenced by this. It’s not an entirely new idea, so I’m not surprised to see that work is being done in the area.

The second is affective empathy, which is sharing the physical experience of somebody else’s emotions. So, if somebody is feeling nervous, somebody high in affective empathy would also feel nervous. These are distinct traits. However, being high in either doesn’t necessarily mean you’re compassionate. Somebody could have high cognitive empathy, and just not care how others feel, or can justify their reasons for hurting others, or are supported by cultural norms or beliefs. Somebody with affective empathy might be overcome by their emotions to the point that they’re not able to be compassionate because they’re overwhelmed.\\n\\nFurthermore, the trouble with compassion is that we are not equally compassionate to all people in all contexts. I recall something from Sapolsky’s ‘Behave’ about women who have stronger ‘in groups’ display more empathy among each other, but show equal fear and disdain of out groups.

Now of course there might be other factors that hold you back from being able to relate to others and manage your own emotions, but a high IQ alone isn't to blame for it.\n",

            "Texto 1147: Disclaimer: You are taking the very first steps of a very long road thrilled by many physicists, many of them never accepted Quantum Mecanics as a physical theory.\\n\\nYour thought experiment were in fact already executed several times and in different situations. There are a lot of underlying conditions you may be missing, I will give you some food for thought:\\n1) Under Quantum Mechanics formalism (QM), energy conservation is not to be understood in the same way you may have under Classical Mechanics. The most striking example of this is the tunneling of particles through a potential greater than its total mechanical energy. But this is not the only one. See the Casimir force, for example;\\n2) In your setup, you are probably taking your 'detectors' as perfect ones, which never miss any detection and does not give false positive. Even in a thought experiment, it is hard to conciliate this with QM formalism. Either way, supposing you have one, you are entering the 'spooky action at distance'. See the debate between Einstein and Bohr on this subject, where Einstein states what was later known as EPR paradox. I consider this a very important criticism because - although Einstein were proved wrong at the end, its questioning gave rise to a whole new field of QM, known as the QM contextuality. The first concise steps in this new field were given by Bell, which stated his famous 'inequality', I suggest you to have a try on this too;\\n3) The true answer to your question is: the speed at which this 'information of detection' should travel is not relevant. What is known is that it happens as long as you adquire information about the system, you have your 'colapse'. Also, it does not violate classical energy conservation, because in the long run, i.e., in the limit where you have a long enough number of trials, total energy will be conserved. If you search for the arguments and references I've mentioned in step 2, you will inevitably end in the so called 'Hidden Variables Theory', which is in fact the begining of the contextuality problem.\n",

            "Texto 1159: This is a new proposal, fresh on the arXiv today, from a group of U.S. particle physicists. The introduction is very readable and lays out the mission clearly:\\n\\n> We can now confidently claim that the “Standard Model” of particle physics (SM) is established. At the same time, we are more and more strongly persuaded that this SM is incomplete. [...] It is now common to describe the SM as an “effective” theory that should be derived from some more fundamental theory at higher energies. But we have almost no evidence on the properties of that theory.\\n\\n> Our successes have become a liability in reaching this goal. Scientists from other fields now have the impression that particle physics is a finished subject. They question our motivations to go on to explore still higher energies. The scale of an energy frontier collider is also challenging to the young people in our field. They need to see qualitatively new capabilities realized during their active scientific careers. [...] That is where the urgency lies.\\n\\n> [T]he entire C3 program could be sited in the United States. With the cancellation of the Superconducting Super Collider and the end of Tevatron operations the US has largely abandoned construction of domestic accelerators at the energy frontier. C3 offers the opportunity to realize an affordable energy frontier facility in the US. This may be crucial to realize a Higgs factory in the near term, and it will also position the US to lead the drive to the next, higher energy stage of exploration.\\n\\nThe main innovation is that they propose to use _non_-superconducting cavities, which allow much higher accelerating fields, cooled to increase their quality factor. The resulting shorter length dramatically decreases the cost, to an estimated $4 billion, which is 80% to 90% less than other proposals. Of course, $4 billion is no small amount of money, but for perspective that's about equal to the monthly budget of the National Institutes of Health, a third of the cost of the James Webb Space Telescope, or 2% of the total cost of the space shuttle.\n",

And if that CO2 is taken back, energy is spent again, and the amount on this \"uptake\" is \\_necessarily at least as much as on the first mixing\\_ --- *in practice*, it's a lot more.   This is very straightforward thermodynamics -- it's why and how a perpetual motion machine is impossible.  \\n\\nPerhaps I've mislead you by letting out, early on, an air that this relation between the energies is somehow 1-to-1, when it's not -- for example, when you burn a log, depending on your furnace etc, \"only\" about 15-30% of the energy released by the burn goes into heating the exhaust flue (and is thereby a component of the \"issue with entropy\" that the fart was originally about).  If I let the impression that 100% does, then it's my mistake.  HOWEVER, the energetics and thermodynamics of releasing that exhaust into the atmosphere is *still* such that I say confidently: you would have to use \\_at least\\_ the energy equivalent to that of burning the original log to get the exhaust back.  Whether this is done by just letting the winds blow over your adsorbant for 100 000 years, or by the flora growing for a 10 000, or by some array of turbines circling the planet and run by solar power for a thousand --- doesn't matter at all.  The fact remains that to reverse an irreversible process, you'll be spending at least the same amount of energy (and in practice, usually, much, much more). \\n\\nThere are many things that go into that confidence, understanding of the laws of thermodynamic being one, the \"sadly\" minute concentration of CO2 another (it would be much, much easier to process the N2 of our atmosphere, for example) -- we can even get to those if you like, but we simply *must* get around the *same* table before its even worthwhile.

There are even reports (I have had one such patient) of people who have a typical NDE experience during seizures.

In Bacteria this is a very small bit of naked DNA that travels through a specialized appendage. The conjugation process of the eukaryote *Paramecium* is different because like all ciliates *Paramecium* has two nuclei, a large and a small, and during conjugation the small nucleus undergoes meiosis and haploid small nuclei are exchanged with the mate. Conjugation in the *Paramecium* results in genetic variation, but does not result in additional organisms, so it is *sexual* but it is not *reproductive*.\\n\\n**Plasmogamy** is the fusion of the protoplasm of two cells (they share a cell membrane) without a nuclear fusion, and I think it is generally used to describe Fungi. My understanding is plasmogamy in fungi (resulting in the dikaryotic cell) is always ultimately followed by a delayed karyogamy. From what I can tell, the process by which *Paramecium* trades nuclei involves plasmogamy as well, but I don't see the word used in that context, so maybe there is some subtlety I am not aware of, or a preferred synonym. More on this below.\\n\\n**Karyogamy** is the fusion of nuclei.\\n\\n**Syngamy** is the fusion of two haploid gametes to form a diploid cell (it is called fertilization in some organisms). Plasmogamy and karyogamy are stage 1 and 2 of syngamy and typically progress quickly except in dikaryotic fungi.\\n\\nPlasmodial slime molds hatch as unicellular amoebas which are haploid gametes (well, sometimes...) and when two sexually compatible amoebas meet they fuse their cytoplasm (plasmogamy) and nuclei (karyogamy) together to become a diploid cell (syngamy), then repeatedly divide their nuclei without cell division to grow to a macroscopic size. To my knowledge, slimes do not perform conjugation, but I have seen that terminology used in older papers. Unfortunately it is not always clear when a scientific term is being used to describe analogous or unrelated processes. Part of the problem with terminology is words can have drastically different definitions in different fields, or even in the same field. \"Guttation\" exists in plants, fungi, and slimes but is not an analogous process, for example. \"Conjugation\" likewise describes two very different processes in bacteria and ciliate eukaryotes. And so plasmogamy, karyogamy, and syngamy may not describe identical processes in different types of organisms, or may be replaced by other synonyms. Hopefully someone with more knowledge can add to this.\n",

Surely we can never really know an animal’s motivation behind an instance of a specific behavior; maybe they are asserting dominance or maybe they’re experiencing same-sex desire—who can definitively say?\\n\\nAll in all, I find the arguments about homosexuality being natural or unnatural because of animal behavior to be unnecessary. Naturalness doesn’t necessarily mean something is good or bad. And anyway, why couldn’t it theoretically be “natural” for the human species and no other? I just think it’s all kind of a fruitless argument, kind of like how when people debate abortion they spend all this time going back and forth about when “life” begins.\\n\\nIn the end, for human homosexuality, I think all we need to know is that a significant portion of our population experiences same-sex desire at some point in their life, maybe their entire life. Whether it’s natural or genetic or “a choice” isn’t really important. What’s important, in my opinion, is who gets to decide what human behaviors are acceptable and to what end? \\n\\nPersonally I want to live in a world where human sexuality is only limited by the absence of consent and the age of the people involved. Maybe other people feel differently, that’s fine. But we should all be asking who benefits and who suffers from their particular agenda.

I don’t think you are considering the thermodynamics relevant to the situation. \\n\\nI don’t know what you mean by “filtering the atmosphere to get to the adsorption part.” The adsorption of CO2 is the same thing as the filtering. The point is to have an adsorbent that is selective for CO2 over other atmospheric gases. \\n\\nHere are two examples explaining why I don’t think your analysis is correct. First, rather than direct air capture people are working on capturing CO2 from a coal or natural gas flue stream. As mentioned in my previous comment, a coal plant will produce a good deal more CO2 than a natural gas plant will for the same amount of energy generated, but this actually doesn’t matter so much for the point I’m trying to make besides making it likely that you would want a different adsorbent material for the the two cases. If what you’re saying is correct, this work would be a completely pointless endeavor. In order to capture the CO2 from the fossil fuel plants, you would have to generate as much energy as they are generating with renewables. There would be no reason to do this if you were correct, yet this is a very active area of research that gets funding from the DOE and other sources. This is more of “proof by authority” than actually addressing your point with a physical argument, but I mention this because it’s one of the main reasons that I initially was skeptical of your claim. There are likely many hundreds or thousands of scientists currently working on, evaluating, and funding this type of research that your apparently simple argument based on the second law of thermodynamics renders pointless. It seems unlikely to me that so many people just haven’t considered this claim, especially since process modeling on the economic and materials cost of these materials is common as well and in that type of modeling, they develop sophisticated thermodynamic and kinetic models of CO2 capture in specific materials. They wouldn’t continue doing this if it were as simple as just having to input as much energy as you initially got out since then it would be a pointless task. \\n\\nThe second example is one I alluded to in my previous comment. Suppose in one case that all of our historical emissions were from coal plants, and these emissions gave us some energy E_c. Suppose in another case that all of our emissions were from natural gas plants, and these emissions gave us some energy E_n. In both cases there would be the same amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, but E_n > E_c since natural gas emits less CO2 than coal for the same amount of energy generated.  By your argument, in these two scenarios, we would have to generate different amounts of energy to capture this carbon dioxide. This doesn’t make sense, however. Once the carbon dioxide is in the air, it doesn’t matter how it got there. We aren’t trying to turn the CO2 back into coal or back into natural gas. Instead we are trying to get it to bind to some material, and the energy required to make the material and unbind the CO2 later (if that’s required for storing it underground) will be fixed for the same material capturing CO2 from the atmosphere, regardless of the source of the CO2 initially. The material doesn’t care if the CO2 came from coal or a fire or from a person breathing. \\n\\nTo address some of your other points, CO2 absorbs IR radiation from the atmosphere, but it also re-emits IR radiation. After absorbing light it doesn’t permanently stay in an excited state. \\n\\nYour fart example misses the point again. The point of carbon capture isn’t to end up with coal or natural gas or whatever else as a byproduct of CO2 capture. The point is going from coal -> CO2 (and other things) -> CO2 bound to some material. It isn’t trying to make something a reversible process.\n",

I miss it, but industry (specifically big finance and big tech) pays so much better, and I'd rather have more money in exchange for working in a field that I'm less passionate about.\\n\\nIf I could send a message back in time 10 years ago to my past self, I'd say to major in CS instead of physics, and then go straight to big tech instead of going to grad school.\\n\\nEDIT: grammar\n",

Liquids tend to compress and expand much less because theyre bound together better than gas.\\n\\nAir moving over a wing will decompress as it makes its journey longer than the journey of air underneath the wing. This fast, decompressed air pulls the winged object upwards, right? Water wont \"give\" in the same way, as i said most liquids are resistent to compression and decompression.

In other words, sometime after a heterotrophic lifestyles developed in the pre-Cambrian, key enzymes in those metabolic pathways were lost, probably when our ancestors were single celled protists. Once those critters started eating other critters, there was no selection to conserve those chains of enzymes in the metabolic pathways.\\n\\nHumans can still synthesize the other proteinogenic amino acids (alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, proline, serine, tyrosine) from other metabolic precursors, though perhaps not at levels ideal for human health. [Glycine](https://www.ias.ac.in/article/fulltext/jbsc/033/05/0771-0780) is of some interest here.\\n\\n\\> Does the body know the difference\\n\\nYes. Some amino acids serve important signaling functions. For example, the most common essential amino acid, leucine, plays a key role in satiety and in telling individual cells whether they should adopt a anabolic (make stuff) or catabolic (recycle trash) tone. In both cases this is via the remarkable metabolic regulator [MTOR](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=mtor&as_occt=title) (mammalian target of rapamycin).\\n\\n\\> Are these then stored or flushed through the lymphatic, on to elimination systems?\\n\\nNope.

That determines in which direction the rope beneath that point is pulling that point on the rope.\\n\\nWell, gravity is proportional to the mass of that length of rope, which is proportional to the length of the rope.\\n\\nAir resistance is proportional to the wind-facing surface area of the rope, which is *also* proportional to the length of the rope.\\n\\nSince these are both proportional to length, as you move down the rope, neither the downward effect of gravity or the approximately horizontal effect of air resistance is able to pull ahead, and the rope is just pulled in the same direction for the entire length.\\n\\n----\\n\\nHere is a more mathematically rigorous explanation:\\n\\nConsider an arbitrary length of the rope.\\n\\nIgnoring other attached segments of rope (which should behave identically), and thus their tension forces, there are two forces acting on the rope: gravity, and air resistance.\\n\\nNet air resistance is proportional to the length of the rope, because the rope's wind-facing area is proportional to its length.\\n\\nNet gravitational force is *also* proportional to the length of the rope, because the rope's mass is proportional to its length.\\n\\nThus, the net force is given by:\\n\\n- **F**_net = **F**_a + **F**_g = L\\***f**_a + L\\***f**_g = L\\*(**f**_a + **f**_g)\\n\\nwhere **F**_a and **F**_g are air resist. and gravity, L is rope length, and **f**_a and **f**_g are the \"per-length\" air resist. and gravity forces.\\n\\nSince the rope is of uniform mass, **f**_g is constant for the entire rope, since gravity is approximately constant along the whole rope, which is short compared to the size of the Earth.\\n\\nIf we assume approximately constant air velocity and air density/makeup around the entire length of the rope, then we also get that **f**_a is constant for the entire rope.\\n\\nSince **f**_a and **f**_g are constant for the whole rope, so is there sum. This means that we have:\\n\\n- **F**_net = L\\***k**\\n\\nwhere **k** = **f**_a + **f**_g is a constant vector.\\n\\nAll this math has resulted in the above equation, which alone tells us the rope should be straight and look like (B). The net force for every segment of rope along the rope, before accounting for tension forces, is in the same direction. When you add tension forces, those will only act parallel or anti-parallel to this net force.\\n\\nThus, the net force along the entire rope will be parallel to a constant direction, which is a straight line.\n",
